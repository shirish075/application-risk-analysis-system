# application-risk-analysis-system
This tool is designed to analyze installed applications and running processes on a Windows system, helping users detect hidden risks in real time. Unlike traditional antivirus tools, our system combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation, VirusTotal API, and a Large Language Model to intelligently classify processes as Safe, Suspicious, or Harmful.
